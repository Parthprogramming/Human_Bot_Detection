3) detect the bot who are missing with the : 
Bots that spoof UA often:

Miss Sec-Fetch-* or Sec-Ch-Ua-* headers

Use wrong header order or casing

Have minimal headers (Accept: */*)

✅ Rule: If User-Agent claims Chrome but headers don’t match → Bot.

2️⃣ Cookie & Session Behavior
Real browsers always handle cookies automatically

Spoofed bots often:

Don’t store cookies

Send new session each request

✅ Rule: If User-Agent looks human but cookies_present = false → Likely bot.

3️⃣ TLS / HTTP Fingerprinting
Advanced detection uses JA3/JA4 TLS fingerprints or HTTP2 fingerprints:

Chrome has a consistent TLS fingerprint

Python requests or Node.js bots cannot perfectly replicate Chrome’s TLS/ALPN order

✅ Compare User-Agent vs TLS fingerprint → Mismatch → Bot.

4️⃣ Request Flow Analysis
Humans navigate: /home → /verify → POST /detect

Bots often directly POST /detect without page visits

✅ If User-Agent claims browser but no previous GET requests → Suspicious.

5️⃣ Rate & Timing Analysis
Humans → 2–5s before submitting a form

Spoofed bots → Instant requests or high frequency

✅ Rule: Short request interval with browser UA → Likely bot.
