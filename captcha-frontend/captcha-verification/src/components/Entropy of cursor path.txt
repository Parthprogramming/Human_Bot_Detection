✅Entropy of cursor path
✅Typing rhythm/variance
Total time between click/submit
Session time + Idle time

|✅ Browser fingerprinting (JS-level)      | Catch Puppeteer, headless Chrome          |
| Interaction timing & latency analysis  | Real humans take time to act              |
| Event consistency validation           | RobotJS fakes input but lacks true events |
| Entropy “too perfect” filter           | Ghost-cursor mimics well — too well       |
| Scroll, hover, idle behavior detection | Bots often skip or fake these             |
| Cursor jitter + hesitation detection   | Smooth bots vs messy humans               |
